# valentine-s-day

A playful Valentine's Day web app that asks "Will you be my Valentine?" with a twist: the **Yes** button is ready to say yes, while the **No** button runs away when you try to click it. After 12 seconds of chasing "No", a cat appears with a friendly nudge and a **Go click Yes!** button to close the overlay and return to the main screen. Say yes to see hearts, confetti, and a happy ending.
